从AT HOP被勒索软件攻击受到的启发

September 14, 2023 ，
The Auckland Transport (AT) transportation authority in New Zealand is dealing with a widespread outage caused by a cyber incident, impacting a wide range of customer services.

AT is the government-owned regional transportation authority in the Auckland region, responsible for public transport through ferries, busses, and trains and for designing and building roads and other infrastructure.

The company has announced today that it's experiencing issues with its HOP services (integrated ticketing and fares system) as a cyber incident has impacted parts of its network.

"The issue is impacting top-ups and other HOP card services. Our staff and operators will ensure you are still able to travel, even if your HOP card is unable to be topped-up." - AT.
According to the latest update published earlier today, the following AT services have been impacted as a result of the attack:

Online top-ups, as well as other AT HOP services using MyAT HOP on the AT website.
Existing auto top-ups work, but there's a delay in the payment processing.
Ticket and top-up machines are only accepting cash payments.
Transactions using Eftpos/credit cards are unavailable. Some machines may not be working.
AT customer service centers will have limited functionality and may only be able to accept cash payments.
HOP retailers cannot top up HOP cards or process other AT HOP services like loading concessions.
